# ðŸ¤– Balancing Bot - SolidWorks 2023 Design

This repository contains the **mechanical CAD design** of a two-wheeled self-balancing robot, created using **SolidWorks 2023**. The design is made with accurate scaling and component fitting, specifically tailored for **NEMA 17 stepper motors**. This project focuses purely on the mechanical structure and does not include any electronics or code.
